I love working with children and helping them grow.

I stay calm and patient in any situation.

I’m responsible and follow safety rules carefully.

I’m creative and know how to keep kids engaged.

I always show up on time and ready to help.

I’m good at solving problems quickly.

I listen carefully and follow instructions from parents.

I keep children safe, clean, and happy.

I’m flexible and can handle surprises.

I enjoy helping children learn through play.
