  <div class="text-block">
    <p>Hi Mei, welcome back. We're glad to continue the interview process with you.</p>
    <p><strong>Thank you, Sarah. I'm happy to continue.</strong></p>
  
    <p>Let's talk a bit about independence. How do you support clients while still respecting their independence?</p>
    <p><strong>I always try to encourage them to do what they can on their own. I offer help only when needed and praise their efforts to build confidence.</strong></p>
  
    <p>Can you tell me about a time when a client had an unexpected medical issue during your shift?</p>
    <p><strong>Yes, one client felt dizzy and almost fell. I helped him sit down safely, checked his blood pressure, and called for medical support. I stayed with him and kept him calm.</strong></p>
  
    <p>That's a great response. How do you organize your time when you're responsible for both personal care and house duties?</p>
    <p><strong>I create a routine that includes both. For example, I may assist with hygiene first, then clean while the client rests. I also prepare meals in advance if possible.</strong></p>
  
    <p>What do you do if a client is not in the mood to cooperate, like refusing to bathe or eat?</p>
    <p><strong>I try to understand why and speak with kindness. I might offer alternatives or give them some time. I never force them but always report to the family or supervisor.</strong></p>
  
    <p>Do you have experience using medical equipment, like a Hoyer lift or blood pressure monitor?</p>
    <p><strong>Yes, I've used both. I had training with a Hoyer lift in my previous job and regularly monitored blood pressure and sugar levels for diabetic clients.</strong></p>
  
    <p>How do you handle confidentiality and sensitive family information?</p>
    <p><strong>I treat all information as private. I don't share details unless required by the care team. Respect and trust are very important in this work.</strong></p>
  
    <p>Have you ever had to adjust to a new client or home very quickly?</p>
    <p><strong>Yes, I had to cover a shift once with a new client I'd never met. I introduced myself kindly, asked questions about their needs, and followed the care plan closely.</strong></p>
  
    <p>Thank you for those insights. Do you have anything else you'd like to share with us?</p>
    <p><strong>Only that I truly care about this work and enjoy helping people feel comfortable and supported at home.</strong></p>
  
    <p>We can see that. Thanks again, Mei. We'll be in touch with next steps soon.</p>
    <p><strong>Thank you. I look forward to the opportunity.</strong></p>
