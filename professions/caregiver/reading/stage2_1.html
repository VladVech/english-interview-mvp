  <div class="text-block">
    <p>Hi Mei, thanks for joining us again for the final interview.</p>
    <p><strong>Hi Sarah, thank you. I'm happy to be here.</strong></p>
  
    <p>We were impressed with your experience and calm approach in our last call. Today, we'd like to go deeper into how you handle real-life caregiving challenges.</p>
    <p><strong>Of course, I'm ready.</strong></p>
  
    <p>Let's start with communication. How do you approach communication with clients who have hearing or memory difficulties?</p>
    <p><strong>I speak clearly, slowly, and maintain eye contact. I also use simple language and repeat things if needed. For memory issues, I write reminders and keep routines consistent.</strong></p>
  
    <p>That's very thoughtful. Have you ever faced a situation where a client was confused or agitated? What did you do?</p>
    <p><strong>Yes, one client became upset because he didn't recognize me. I stayed calm, gave him space, and gently reminded him who I was. I offered familiar music to help soothe him.</strong></p>
  
    <p>That shows great patience. What's your method for managing multiple responsibilities during a shift?</p>
    <p><strong>I make a task list at the start of each shift and prioritize based on urgency. I also set gentle reminders for medication and meals, and try to stay ahead of schedule.</strong></p>
  
    <p>Do you feel confident communicating with family members and reporting on the client's condition?</p>
    <p><strong>Yes. I usually update them politely and clearly, focusing on important changes or concerns. I understand that families rely on us to notice early signs.</strong></p>
  
    <p>What role does emotional support play in your work?</p>
    <p><strong>It's a big part of caregiving. Some clients feel lonely or scared, especially if they live alone. I try to talk with them, listen actively, and help them feel safe and respected.</strong></p>
  
    <p>Are you familiar with end-of-life care, and if so, how do you handle that emotionally and professionally?</p>
    <p><strong>Yes, I've assisted hospice clients before. It's emotional, but I try to stay strong for them and their families. I offer comfort and keep their dignity a priority.</strong></p>
  
    <p>That's an important quality. Do you have any questions for us or anything you'd like to add before we finish?</p>
    <p><strong>Yes, I'd like to ask if there are opportunities for ongoing training or becoming a team leader in the future.</strong></p>
  
    <p>Absolutely. We offer continued learning and support growth within the team. Thank you again, Mei.</p>
    <p><strong>Thank you. I really appreciate the opportunity and hope to contribute to your team.</strong></p>
