Can you briefly tell me about your background in UI/UX design?

Sure. I completed a UI/UX design course last year and have been working for about a year in a junior design role. I’ve worked on mobile app and web interface projects, focusing on user flows, wireframes, and visual design.

What design tools do you use most often?

I mainly use Figma for wireframing, prototyping, and collaboration. I also use Adobe XD and sometimes Photoshop or Illustrator for asset creation.

What types of projects have you worked on so far?

I’ve worked on a mobile health tracking app, a website redesign for a local business, and some landing pages for a SaaS product. Most of my work has been in user interface design with some involvement in research.

What’s your process when starting a new design project?

I start by understanding the user and business goals, review any research or data available, create wireframes and low-fidelity prototypes, and then iterate based on feedback before moving to high-fidelity designs.

Do you have experience with user research or usability testing?

Yes. I’ve helped prepare user surveys and moderated a few usability tests. I also reviewed feedback and helped translate it into design improvements.

Are you comfortable working with developers?

Yes. In my last role, I worked closely with developers to hand off designs and clarify interactions. I made sure everything was well-documented in Figma and used components for consistency.

How do you handle feedback from clients or stakeholders?

I try to stay open and listen carefully. If I disagree, I ask questions to understand their concerns and then explain my design decisions clearly. I see feedback as part of the creative process.

What type of projects or industries interest you most?

I’m especially interested in health tech, education, and productivity tools—products that solve real user problems and require thoughtful UX.

Are you looking for remote, hybrid, or in-office work?

I’m open to remote or hybrid. I’ve worked both ways and value flexibility as long as communication is strong.

Do you have any questions for us?

Yes. How is the design team structured here, and what’s the usual design-review process like?
