Can you walk me through one of your recent UI/UX projects?

Yes. I recently designed a mobile health tracking app. I started by researching user pain points, then mapped out user flows, created wireframes in Figma, and iterated based on usability feedback. I also built a design system for consistent styling.

How do you approach designing for both usability and visual appeal?

I focus on hierarchy, spacing, and consistency to create intuitive layouts. I also follow accessibility guidelines and design patterns while keeping the brand style and visual clarity in mind.

How do you decide which features to prioritize in a user interface?

I consider user needs, business goals, and technical feasibility. I work with product managers to align priorities and validate with users when possible.

What do you include when handing off designs to developers?

I make sure all components and screens are fully annotated in Figma, with spacing, states, and interactions clear. I provide responsive layouts and document the design system if needed.

Have you worked with design systems or created one?

Yes. I helped expand a small design system in Figma by creating consistent buttons, inputs, color tokens, and typography styles. It made handoff and iteration much faster.

How do you test whether your design is user-friendly?

I run quick usability tests with prototypes, observe where users struggle, and collect feedback. I also use simple A/B tests or surveys when applicable.

What’s your experience with responsive design?

I always design for mobile first, then scale up to tablet and desktop. I test layouts at different breakpoints and adjust components to stay usable across screen sizes.

Have you worked with any accessibility standards?

Yes. I pay attention to contrast ratios, font sizes, tap targets, and clear labels. I try to follow WCAG basics to ensure the product is inclusive.

How do you know when a design is “done”?

When it meets user needs, business goals, and is tested and refined. If it solves the problem, is accessible, and developers can implement it confidently, I consider it ready.

How do you keep improving your skills as a designer?

I follow design blogs, take short online courses, review good case studies on Behance and Dribbble, and ask for feedback from more senior designers whenever I can.
