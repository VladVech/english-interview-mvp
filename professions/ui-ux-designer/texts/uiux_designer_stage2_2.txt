Tell me about a time you received difficult feedback on a design. How did you respond?

A client once said my design felt too “flat” and didn’t match their brand. I asked follow-up questions to understand what they meant, reviewed their brand materials, and adjusted the color palette and visuals. In the end, they were happy with the changes.

How do you handle working on a project where requirements change often?

I stay flexible and make sure I’m aligned with the product owner. I try to work in low-fidelity as long as possible and keep components reusable so I can adapt quickly.

Describe a time you had a disagreement with a developer or stakeholder.

A developer pushed back on a layout I designed for mobile. I explained the reasoning behind the design, and we ended up collaborating on a compromise that worked better for both UX and implementation.

How do you stay productive when juggling multiple design tasks?

I use tools like Notion and Trello to track tasks, prioritize based on deadlines, and block focused time for deep work. I also set check-ins to stay aligned with the team.

What motivates you as a designer?

Helping people use products more easily and enjoyably. I like solving real problems and improving things that frustrate users.

Have you ever had to design something for a product you didn’t fully understand?

Yes. I worked on a feature for a healthcare tool. I spent time researching the context, asking domain experts, and testing with real users to make sure my assumptions were correct.

What would you do if you delivered a design and later realized you forgot an important use case?

I’d bring it up right away, suggest a fix, and update the design. I believe in being honest and solving the problem fast rather than hiding it.

How do you build good relationships with developers and other team members?

I stay open, communicate clearly, listen to their input, and respect their time. I try to be a team player who helps make everyone’s job easier.

What are your career goals as a UI/UX designer?

In the next few years, I’d like to become a mid-level or senior designer, work on larger products, and maybe mentor junior designers. I’m also interested in learning more about UX strategy.

Do you have any questions for us?

Yes. How does your team balance creativity and consistency in the design process, especially when scaling products?
