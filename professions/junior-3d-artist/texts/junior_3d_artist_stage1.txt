Can you tell me about your education and how you got into 3D art?

Sure. I recently graduated from a 3D animation program where I focused on modeling and texturing. During my studies, I worked on several short films and game assets, and I fell in love with creating environments and props.

What software are you most comfortable using right now?

I primarily use Blender for modeling, Substance Painter for texturing, and Marmoset for rendering. I’m also learning more about Unreal Engine for real-time rendering and scene setup.

What kind of projects have you worked on so far?

At school, I worked on a group project to build a sci-fi corridor in Unreal. I modeled props and handled the material setup. I’ve also done personal projects, including stylized environments and game-ready assets.

Why are you interested in joining our studio?

I admire your work, especially the strong visual storytelling in your environments. I’m looking for a team where I can grow, learn from experienced artists, and contribute to meaningful projects.

Do you have any experience working with game engines?

Yes, mostly with Unreal Engine. I’ve imported models, set up materials, and built basic lighting. I’ve also tried Unity for simple interactive scenes.

How do you handle feedback and critique on your work?

I appreciate clear and constructive feedback. It helps me improve. I try to implement changes quickly and always ask questions if something is unclear.

Are you able to meet deadlines and manage your time?

Yes. I’m used to working with strict deadlines at school and during internships. I usually create a checklist and break tasks into smaller steps to stay on track.

Are you looking for remote, in-office, or hybrid work?

I’m flexible. I’ve worked remotely during school but would also enjoy being in a studio to learn directly from teammates.

What are your salary expectations?

Since this would be my first full-time role, I’m open to discussing a fair junior-level salary based on industry standards and your expectations.

Do you have any questions for us?

Yes. What’s the usual workflow for junior artists in your team? And how do you support skill development and training?
