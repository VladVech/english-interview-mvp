Tell me about a time you faced a creative or technical challenge. How did you handle it?

During my final year project, I had to create a complex environment with tight performance constraints. I solved it by switching to modular design, using trim sheets, and baking high-poly details into normal maps. It taught me a lot about efficiency.

How do you respond when you're asked to redo or significantly change a piece of work?

I try not to take it personally. I listen to the feedback, ask follow-up questions if needed, and then revise the work. It’s part of the process and helps me grow.

Describe how you manage your time when juggling multiple tasks or projects.

I prioritize based on deadlines and complexity. I break down big tasks into smaller steps, keep to-do lists, and set internal checkpoints to stay on track without getting overwhelmed.

Have you ever had to collaborate with people from other departments?

Yes, I worked with animators and level designers during school projects. We discussed asset needs early, kept communication clear, and adjusted our workflows to support each other’s goals.

What motivates you as a 3D artist?

Seeing my work come to life in an actual scene or game is a huge motivator. I also enjoy learning new tools and getting better with every project.

How do you handle pressure or tight deadlines?

I stay focused and organized. If something unexpected comes up, I adjust the schedule and communicate early. I do my best to deliver on time without compromising quality.

What would your ideal first project look like?

Something small but meaningful—maybe a hero prop or part of an environment set where I can take ownership, learn the pipeline, and get feedback along the way.

Where do you see yourself in the next few years?

I hope to grow into a mid-level artist, possibly mentoring others, and contributing to bigger parts of the project. Long-term, I’d like to specialize in environments or work on stylized game art.

What do you think is most important for junior artists in their first studio role?

Being open to feedback, asking good questions, delivering on time, and being easy to work with. Technical skills matter, but attitude and communication are key.

Do you have any questions for us?

Yes. How do junior artists typically grow within your team, and are there any mentorship or training opportunities?
