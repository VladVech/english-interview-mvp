Can you walk me through your process for creating a game-ready prop?

Sure. I start by gathering references and blocking out the shape in Blender. Once I’m happy with the silhouette, I move to high-poly sculpting if needed, then retopologize for low-poly. I UV unwrap, bake maps in Marmoset or Substance, and texture using smart materials and custom layers. I test the asset in-engine before finalizing.

What do you focus on when unwrapping UVs?

I make sure to use the UV space efficiently, avoid stretching, and keep seams hidden where possible. I also try to maintain consistent texel density across the model.

How do you approach baking and texturing?

For baking, I double-check the mesh naming and cage settings, and I test bakes on a preview map first. In texturing, I think about storytelling—adding wear, dirt, and variation where it makes sense. I work in layers and use masks to stay non-destructive.

Have you worked with modular assets or trim sheets?

Yes. I created a modular sci-fi hallway set in Unreal, using repeatable meshes and trim sheets. It helped optimize the scene and made it easier to build variations.

What is your experience with shaders or material setups?

I’ve used Unreal’s material editor to create basic master materials with parameters for color, roughness, and normal intensity. I also experimented with vertex painting and parallax effects.

Can you explain how you optimize assets for performance?

I reduce poly count where detail isn’t needed, use normal maps instead of geometry, and pack texture maps efficiently. I also keep draw calls in mind when placing assets in-engine.

How do you handle receiving detailed feedback from a lead artist?

I take notes and ask clarifying questions to be sure I understand. Then I apply the changes step by step and share work-in-progress for review. I see feedback as an essential part of learning.

Have you used version control tools like Perforce or Git?

I’ve used GitHub for personal projects and I’m currently learning Perforce workflows through tutorials. I understand the basics of commits, branches, and keeping files synced.

How do you present your work in a portfolio or review?

I create beauty renders in Marmoset or Unreal, include wireframes and texture breakdowns, and show turntables when possible. I also write short notes on my process and challenges I overcame.

What areas of 3D art are you most interested in improving?

I’d like to improve my sculpting for organic assets and my lighting skills for better scene presentation. I’m also interested in learning more about real-time VFX and environment storytelling.
