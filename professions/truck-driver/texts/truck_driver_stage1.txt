Can you tell me about your truck driving experience?

Yes. I have been driving trucks for over 3 years. I have experience with long-distance deliveries and local routes. I’ve driven mostly dry vans and box trucks.

Do you have a valid commercial driver’s license (CDL)?

Yes. I have a Class 1 (or Class A) license, and my record is clean. I also have air brake endorsement.

Are you comfortable driving long distances or overnight?

Yes. I have done long hauls before and I’m used to driving at night or early morning if needed.

What types of cargo have you transported?

I’ve carried general freight, food, and some construction materials. I always check the load and secure it properly.

How do you check your truck before a trip?

I do a full pre-trip inspection: tires, lights, brakes, mirrors, fluids, and trailer connection. I also check the load and paperwork.

How do you handle bad weather while driving?

I slow down, increase following distance, and keep both hands on the wheel. If it’s too dangerous, I stop and wait until it’s safe.

How do you stay alert on long trips?

I take breaks, drink water, listen to music or radio, and make sure I get enough sleep before a trip.

Have you ever had to deal with a breakdown or emergency on the road?

Yes. Once I had a flat tire on the highway. I pulled over safely, turned on hazard lights, used cones, and called for roadside assistance.

Do you have experience with electronic logs or paper logs?

Yes. I’ve used both. I’m comfortable using ELD systems and following Hours of Service rules.

Do you have any questions for me?

Yes. What kind of routes would I be driving, and do you provide the truck or should I have my own?
