Tell me about a time you had a problem on the road. How did you handle it?

One time, my truck broke down on a remote highway. I pulled over safely, turned on my hazard lights, placed warning triangles, and called for help. I stayed calm and waited for the mechanic to arrive.

How do you manage your time when you have several stops to make in one day?

I plan my route ahead, check traffic and weather, and follow my GPS. I leave early to stay ahead of schedule and avoid rushing.

What would you do if a customer says you were late, but you know you were on time?

I would stay calm and polite. I’d show my delivery log or timestamp and explain the situation. If needed, I’d let dispatch handle the disagreement.

How do you handle stress during long trips?

I take breaks, stretch, eat well, and try to get enough rest. I also listen to music or podcasts to stay relaxed and focused.

Have you ever had to work with a difficult dispatcher or manager?

Yes. I had a dispatcher who changed plans often. I stayed respectful and asked for clear instructions. I focused on doing my job and being reliable.

What would you do if you noticed another driver on the team was breaking safety rules?

I would talk to them if it’s safe, or report it to the supervisor. Safety is everyone’s responsibility.

What’s more important to you — speed or safety?

Safety. It’s better to arrive late than not at all. I always drive safely and follow the rules.

How do you prepare for a long trip across provinces or states?

I plan the route, check rest stops and fuel stations, look at the weather, and pack food and water. I make sure my truck is ready and I’m well rested.

What would you do if you made a small mistake that no one noticed?

I would still report it. Even small mistakes can become big problems later. I believe in being honest and responsible.

Do you have any questions for us?

Yes. How are routes assigned here, and how do you support drivers during long hauls or breakdowns?
