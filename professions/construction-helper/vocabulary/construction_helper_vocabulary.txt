I follow safety instructions carefully.

I’m strong and ready for physical work.

I show up on time and work hard.

I learn quickly and ask questions if unsure.

I stay calm when things get busy.

I enjoy building and fixing things.

I take pride in working as part of a team.

I pay attention to every step in the job.

I’m not afraid to get dirty or tired.

I always finish what I start.
