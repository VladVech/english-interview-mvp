Tell me about a time you had to work hard or do something physical for a long time.

Last summer I helped my uncle build a fence. We worked all day digging holes, lifting wood, and putting it together. It was tough, but I liked seeing the result.

How do you handle doing the same task over and over?

I just focus and try to do it well. I don’t mind repetition, especially if I know it helps the team or keeps the site clean and safe.

What would you do if another worker was rushing and being unsafe?

I would keep my distance and tell the supervisor if it seemed dangerous. I want to work on a team where everyone is safe.

How do you stay motivated during hard work?

I think about finishing the job and learning new skills. I also like being active, so physical work doesn’t bother me.

Have you ever worked with someone you didn’t get along with?

At school, yes. I just stayed respectful and focused on the work. I try to get along with everyone, even if we’re different.

What would you do if it started raining while you were working outside?

I’d wait for the supervisor’s instructions. If it’s safe to continue, I’d keep going. If not, I’d help pack up or move tasks indoors.

Are you okay with getting dirty, dusty, or sweaty on the job?

Yes. I expect it. I know construction isn’t a clean job and that’s fine with me.

How would you handle being corrected by a supervisor?

I’d listen, say thank you, and fix the problem. I want to learn and get better, not argue.

What would you do if you finished a task and didn’t know what to do next?

I’d let the supervisor know or ask someone on the team. I always want to stay useful.

Do you have any questions for us?

Yes. Is there a chance to keep working after the summer, and can helpers move up to more skilled jobs over time?
