Can you tell me a little about yourself and why you want to work in construction?

I just finished high school and I’m looking for a job where I can learn new skills and work with my hands. I’m interested in construction because I like building things and working outdoors.

Do you have any experience with tools or helping on job sites?

Not professionally, but I’ve helped family members with small projects like painting, carrying materials, and using simple tools like a hammer and drill.

Are you comfortable working outside in different weather?

Yes. I know construction can be hot or cold, and I’m okay with that. I’m ready to work hard in any condition.

Are you able to lift heavy materials and stand for long hours?

Yes. I’m in good shape and don’t mind physical work. I’ve done sports in school and like staying active.

Can you work early mornings or long hours if needed?

Yes. I’m available full-time and I don’t mind starting early or working overtime when needed.

How do you follow instructions from supervisors or team leaders?

I listen carefully, ask questions if I’m not sure, and try to do the task the right way the first time.

Do you have a driver’s license or a way to get to the job site?

Yes. I have a license and access to a car, or I can take the bus if needed.

What do you know about safety on a construction site?

I know safety is very important. I’d always wear the right gear like a helmet and boots, and I’d follow all instructions to keep myself and others safe.

Would you be okay doing cleanup, carrying materials, or helping more skilled workers?

Yes, that’s exactly what I expect to do as a helper. I’m here to learn and support the team.

Do you have any questions for me?

Yes. Will I get any training when I start? And what kind of tasks do helpers usually do in the first few weeks?
