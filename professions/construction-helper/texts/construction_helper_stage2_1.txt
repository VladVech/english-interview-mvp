I’ve used a hammer, screwdriver, tape measure, shovel, and a drill for small home projects. I’m open to learning how to use more tools properly.

Do you know how to measure or cut materials?

Yes, I know how to use a tape measure and follow basic measurements. I’ve used a handsaw before and can follow markings.

What safety gear should you wear on a construction site?

Hard hat, safety boots, gloves, and sometimes a safety vest or goggles, depending on the job. I know it’s important to wear the right gear at all times.

How would you carry heavy materials safely?

I would bend my knees, lift with my legs, and ask for help if the load is too heavy. I’d also watch where I’m walking.

What would you do if you didn’t understand how to do a task?

I’d ask the supervisor or someone more experienced. I’d rather ask than do something wrong or unsafe.

Cleaning the site, moving materials, loading and unloading trucks, holding ladders, or helping skilled workers like carpenters or electricians.

Yes. In school I did group projects and team sports. I know how to communicate and work together to get the job done.

What would you do if you saw something unsafe on the site?

I would stop and tell the supervisor right away. I know safety is more important than speed.

Do you know how to read simple instructions or labels on tools and materials?

Yes. I can follow written directions and warning labels. I always read before using something I’m not familiar with.

Are you willing to learn new skills like mixing concrete or using power tools?

Yes. I want to learn everything I can. I’m serious about doing this kind of work and building a future in it.
