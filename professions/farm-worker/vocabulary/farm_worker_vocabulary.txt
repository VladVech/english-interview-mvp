I’m not afraid of hard physical work.

I take pride in doing my job well.

I’m reliable and always show up on time.

I’m quick to learn how to use tools and equipment.

I work well with others and alone.

I stay calm and focused, even when it’s hot or raining.

I follow directions and safety rules carefully.

I always finish what I start.

I’m strong, active, and not afraid to get dirty.

I enjoy being outdoors and working with my hands.
