What kind of crops have you worked with before?

I worked with tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce, and strawberries.

How do you know when it’s time to harvest a crop?

I check the color, size, and if the fruit is soft or ready. The boss also tells us when it’s time.

Have you used irrigation systems before?

Yes. I helped set up drip lines and watered plants by hand when needed.

I tell the supervisor. Sometimes we remove bad plants or use spray to stop the problem.

Do you know how to use fertilizers or sprays?

Yes. I follow instructions and wear safety clothes when I use them.

How do you protect yourself when working outside in hot or cold weather?

I wear a hat and drink water in the sun. In cold, I wear warm clothes and gloves.

Have you ever worked in a greenhouse?

Yes. It was warm and we planted seeds, watered plants, and cleaned the area.

Do you have any experience working with animals?

A little. I helped feed chickens and clean their area.

What do you do if you finish your job early?

I ask what else I can help with. I don’t like to wait or waste time.
