Tell me about a time you worked very hard on a job.

Last summer, I picked strawberries for 10 hours a day. It was hot, but I didn’t stop until the work was done.

What do you do if you don’t understand instructions?

I ask again or ask someone to show me. I want to do the job right.

Have you ever helped train a new worker?

Yes. I showed a new person how to pick cucumbers and where to put them.

How do you work with other team members?

I try to be friendly and help if someone needs it. We finish faster when we work together.

What do you do if someone on the team is not working well?

I focus on my job and tell the boss if there is a big problem.

What do you like most about farm work?

I like being outside and seeing how plants grow. It feels good to work with my hands.

How do you feel about working long hours during harvest season?

I can do it. I know harvest is busy, and I’m ready to help when needed.

Can you follow a work schedule and be on time every day?

Yes. I always come on time and try not to miss any days.

Have you worked at night or early morning before?

Yes. I started at 5 a.m. before. It’s okay for me.

Do you have any questions for us?

Yes. Do you have work all year, or only in the summer?
