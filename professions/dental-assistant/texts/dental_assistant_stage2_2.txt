Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a difficult patient. What did you do?

There was a patient who was very anxious and didn’t want to open their mouth. I spoke to them calmly, explained each step, and gave them control by asking them to raise their hand if they felt discomfort. Eventually, they relaxed and completed the treatment.

How do you handle feedback from a dentist, especially if it’s critical?

I listen carefully and take notes if needed. I see feedback as a way to improve my skills. If I’m unsure about something, I ask for clarification and make sure I don’t repeat the mistake.

Describe a time when you had to adapt quickly to a change during the workday.

One day, a patient had to cancel last minute, and we had an emergency walk-in. I quickly cleaned and reset the room, updated the schedule, and prepared for the new procedure without delay.

How do you prioritize your tasks when the clinic is very busy?

I focus on patient care first, make sure treatment rooms are ready, and help the front desk if needed. I keep track of what’s most urgent and communicate with the team to stay efficient.

Have you ever had a conflict with a coworker? How did you resolve it?

Yes, once I had a disagreement with a colleague over room preparation. I spoke to her privately and shared my point of view. We agreed on a shared checklist, and since then, things have been smooth.

What motivates you in your work as a dental assistant?

I like helping people feel better about their health and smile. I enjoy being part of a team and knowing that my work supports both the dentist and the patient.

How do you make sure patients have a good experience at the clinic?

I greet them with a smile, explain what to expect, and answer any questions. I try to stay kind, patient, and professional throughout their visit.

What are your long-term career goals in the dental field?

I’d like to continue learning and maybe become a certified level II assistant. I’m also interested in training new assistants in the future.

Do you prefer working in a large clinic or a small private practice?

I’ve worked in both. I enjoy the fast pace of a larger clinic but also like the personal connection you get in a smaller practice. I’m comfortable in either environment.

Do you have any questions for us?

Yes, I’d love to know more about the team culture and if there are opportunities for training or professional development.
