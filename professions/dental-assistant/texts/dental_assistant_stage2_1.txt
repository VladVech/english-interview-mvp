What steps do you take to ensure all instruments are properly sterilized?

First, I rinse and scrub the instruments, then place them in the ultrasonic cleaner. After that, I package them and use the autoclave for full sterilization. I also log the cycle to ensure everything is documented.

How do you prepare a treatment room for a new patient?

I disinfect all surfaces, place clean barriers, set up the necessary tools and materials based on the scheduled procedure, and check that everything is stocked and ready for the dentist.

Can you describe how you assist during a typical filling procedure?

I pass instruments to the dentist, suction to keep the area dry, mix materials if needed, and comfort the patient. I stay alert and ready to anticipate the dentist’s next steps.

What experience do you have with dental charting?

I’ve done both paper and digital charting. I record the dentist’s findings, mark treatment plans, and update patient histories using the clinic’s dental software.

How do you handle a situation when a patient is nervous or scared?

I speak calmly, explain each step of the procedure, and reassure them. I give them time to ask questions and encourage them to signal if they feel uncomfortable.

What would you do if you noticed a possible infection in a patient’s mouth before the dentist arrived?

I would note the concern, inform the dentist right away, and follow their instructions. I would not give advice directly to the patient, but I’d make sure the dentist is aware.

What types of x-rays have you taken, and how do you ensure proper safety?

I’ve taken bitewing, panoramic, and periapical x-rays. I always use protective aprons, ensure the machine is calibrated, and follow all positioning protocols.

Have you worked with any dental software systems?

Yes, I’ve used systems like Dentrix and AbelDent for scheduling, charting, and billing. I’m comfortable learning new software quickly.

How do you manage time when the clinic schedule is very full?

I stay organized, prepare in advance, and communicate with the dentist and receptionist. If we run behind, I do my best to catch up without rushing the patient care.

Can you describe a time when you made a mistake and how you handled it?

Once, I set up the tray with the wrong type of impression material. I realized it before the dentist started, quickly corrected it, and apologized. Since then, I double-check every tray setup.
