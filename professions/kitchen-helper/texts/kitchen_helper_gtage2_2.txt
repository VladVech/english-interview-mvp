What would you do if the cook asked you to do two things at the same time?

I would ask which one is more important to do first. Then I would do both as fast as I can, in the right order.

If you were asked to clean something you've never cleaned before, what would you do?

I would ask how to do it correctly. I don’t want to damage anything, so I’d rather ask and learn.

How do you make sure you're doing a good job?

I check my work and ask for feedback. If someone tells me how to improve, I try to do better next time.

Have you ever had to deal with someone angry before?

Not at work, but sometimes at school or in public. I try to stay calm, not talk back, and let someone in charge handle it if needed.

What would you do if you felt very tired during your shift?

I would keep going and do my best. If I needed a short break, I’d ask politely, but I understand it’s important to finish my tasks.

How do you remember tasks when the kitchen is loud and busy?

I listen carefully, repeat the instructions to myself, and sometimes ask again to make sure I heard right.

What’s more important: working fast or working carefully?

Both. I try to work fast, but I also want to be safe and do things right. I think doing both is important in a kitchen.

Would you be okay helping with garbage or cleaning the bathroom?

Yes. I know it’s part of the job. I don’t mind as long as I have the right tools and safety stuff.

How do you feel about wearing a uniform and following kitchen rules?

That’s fine with me. I like knowing what to wear and what the rules are. It helps keep things fair and clean.

If you really enjoy the job, would you be open to working after summer or on weekends?

Yes, if my school schedule allows it, I’d like to keep working part-time. It would be good to keep learning and saving money.
