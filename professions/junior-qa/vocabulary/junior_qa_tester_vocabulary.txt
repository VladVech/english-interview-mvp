I enjoy finding bugs and improving software.

I’m detail-oriented and careful in my work.

I’m good at documenting test results clearly.

I follow test cases and instructions precisely.

I stay calm and focused when issues arise.

I ask questions and learn from feedback.

I like working closely with developers.

I test thoroughly before signing off.

I learn new tools and systems quickly.

I always meet deadlines and take responsibility.
