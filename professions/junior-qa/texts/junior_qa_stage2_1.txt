Can you explain the difference between severity and priority in bug tracking?

Sure. Severity is about how serious the bug is technically — for example, if the app crashes, it's high severity. Priority is about how urgently the bug should be fixed — for example, a typo on the homepage may be low severity but high priority.

What are the main components of a good bug report?

A good bug report includes a clear title, steps to reproduce, expected and actual results, environment info (like browser or OS), severity and priority, and any screenshots or videos to help developers understand the issue.

How do you handle testing when requirements are not clear?

I ask questions, talk to the product owner or developer, and try to understand the goal. If needed, I write test cases based on the user story or expected user behavior.

Can you describe what regression testing is and when to perform it?

Regression testing means testing existing features after a code change to make sure nothing is broken. It’s done after bug fixes, new feature releases, or big code changes.

What’s the difference between black box and white box testing?

Black box testing means testing the software without knowing the internal code — focusing on input and output. White box testing means testing with knowledge of how the code works, usually done by developers.

Have you written or executed test cases before?

Yes. I’ve written test cases in TestRail and Excel. I list test steps, expected results, and mark them as pass or fail after execution. I also add comments or bugs if needed.

How would you test a search bar on a website?

I would test with valid input, empty input, special characters, numbers, too long strings, misspellings, and edge cases. I’d also check auto-suggestions, filters, and result accuracy.

Do you have any experience with API testing?

Only basic experience. I’ve used Postman to send GET and POST requests and check status codes and response bodies. I’m learning how to check headers and use parameters.

What is exploratory testing?

Exploratory testing means testing the app without a set plan, using creativity and experience to find unexpected issues. It’s useful for finding bugs that test cases may miss.

How do you work with developers when they reject your reported bug?

I double-check the bug, provide more evidence if needed, and talk with the developer to understand their view. If we still disagree, I bring in a QA lead or product owner to help decide.
