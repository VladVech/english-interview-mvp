Can you tell me about your background and how you got into QA?

Sure. I recently completed a QA testing course where I learned about manual testing, writing test cases, and basic automation. I also did a small internship where I helped test a web application.

What types of testing are you familiar with?

I’ve worked with functional testing, UI testing, regression testing, and smoke testing. I’ve also learned the basics of API and automation testing.

Have you used any bug tracking or test management tools?

Yes. I used Jira for bug tracking and TestRail to write and manage test cases. I’m comfortable using those kinds of tools to stay organized.

What is a test case, and how do you write one?

A test case is a set of steps to check if a feature works as expected. I include a test ID, steps to follow, expected result, and actual result. I try to keep it simple and clear.

Can you describe how you report a bug?

I write a clear title, describe how to reproduce it, what I expected, what actually happened, and include screenshots or video if possible. I also add severity and priority.

Have you done any automation testing?

Only basics. I’ve used Selenium with Java and Python for small scripts. I can write simple locators and check element presence. I’d like to learn more.

How do you test a login form?

I test with valid and invalid inputs, empty fields, special characters, wrong passwords, and check for error messages. I also test the “remember me” and password visibility options.

Do you prefer working alone or in a team?

I like both. I enjoy focusing when testing alone, but I also like working with developers and other testers to solve problems.

What are your salary expectations?

I’m looking for an entry-level QA role, so I’m open to a fair starting salary and focused on growing my skills.

Do you have any questions for us?

Yes. How is your QA team structured, and do junior testers get support or mentorship?
