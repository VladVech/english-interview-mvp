What steps do you take to prepare food safely?

I wash my hands, wear gloves, and keep raw and cooked food separate. I check temperatures and clean my station often.

Can you describe how you make a popular menu item, like a burger or fries?

Yes. For a burger, I grill the patty, toast the bun, and add the toppings in order. For fries, I cook them in the fryer, shake off the oil, add salt, and serve hot.

What do you do if the order screen shows five new orders at once?

I read the tickets quickly, start the longest items first, and work in order. I talk to my teammates so we all move fast and stay organized.

How do you know when food is cooked properly?

I check the timer and look at the color and texture. For meat, we also use a thermometer sometimes. Everything must be hot and fully cooked.

Have you worked with a deep fryer or grill?

Yes. I used both. I know how to load the fryer basket safely and keep the grill clean during the shift.

What would you do if you dropped food on the floor during a rush?

I throw it away, clean the area, and remake the item. I never serve dropped food, even when it’s busy.

How do you restock supplies during your shift?

When I have a break between orders, I check sauces, napkins, and kitchen items. I refill things before they run out.

What should you do if a customer says their order is wrong?

I say sorry, listen to what’s wrong, and tell the manager or fix it myself if I can. I stay calm and friendly.

Can you give an example of working under pressure?

One night we had a big line at the drive-thru and inside. I worked fast on the grill, helped bag orders, and stayed focused until we finished.

Do you follow cleaning checklists at the end of the shift?

Yes. I wipe down surfaces, sweep and mop, clean equipment, and take out the trash. We check everything before leaving.
