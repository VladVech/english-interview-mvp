Tell me about a time when you helped a teammate during a busy shift.

One time, the person at the register was overwhelmed, so I stepped in to help take orders while still cooking burgers. We worked together and kept the line moving.

What would you do if a coworker was not doing their part of the job?

I would try to help if I can, and if it keeps happening, I’d tell the shift leader. We all need to work as a team.

How do you keep a good attitude during a long, busy day?

I try to stay positive, take short breaks if allowed, and focus on helping customers. I remind myself that it will slow down soon.

Have you ever made a mistake at work? What did you do?

Yes, I gave a customer the wrong order once. I told the manager right away and apologized to the customer. We fixed it fast.

What do you like most about working in fast food?

I like the fast pace, working with people, and seeing customers leave happy. The day goes by quickly.

What motivates you to do a good job?

I feel proud when I do my job well. I want to keep my team happy and be someone the manager can count on.

Do you want to grow in this company or learn new roles?

Yes. I’d like to learn how to lead shifts or train new workers. I’m open to more responsibility.

How do you respond to changes, like a new menu or new rules?

I try to learn fast and ask questions if I don’t understand. I don’t mind changes—it keeps the job interesting.

Do you enjoy working with customers?

Yes. I like saying hello, taking orders, and helping people. Even if they’re not always happy, I try to make their visit better.

Do you have any questions for us?

Yes. Is there a chance to become a shift leader later? And how soon can I start if I’m hired?
